# Machine Learning for Hotel Reservations


**Project description:**

In recent years, an increasing number of hotels have been offering their customers the option to cancel a reservation or booking up to a few days before arrival.

This new feature led to some new and unforeseen consequences. Many hotels were left unprepared, some rooms remained empty and the hotel was even overbooked, due to incorrect estimates of the cancellations.

In this project, We seek to address this problem. Based on previous reservations and cancellations at the hotel, one can predict which reservations will indeed be canceled and which ones will not; thus, the hotel will be able to display more rooms as available also avoid overbooking situations. Ultimately, this will maximize the hotelâ€™s occupancy capacity and increase its revenue.


The code and the data are used for Machine learning classifcation, the data is taken from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset).
